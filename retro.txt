Reflection and learnings from GGJ 2020.

Goal was to make game with:
* "Dead artist Society" diversifier
* possibly no text, so could be played by people who don't speak same language
* play time within 10 minutes
* suitable for 2-10 players, with optimal number: 4


I wasn't able to convince others to join me, so it become 1 person work.

Learnings:

Doing alone is hard, especially hard to playtest.
Drawing skills was not enough to do anything reasonable, and fall back to text version.
Able to playtest first version already at the end of Friday, and got valuable feedback.
Tried to get feedback from other teams about idea and gameplay.
Regular feedback and playtests form 50% of the game (I will not be able to come up with these good ideas on my own).
It helped to define important milestones in the first hours of the jam.
Sleeping 8+ hours every day and have enough food helped to keep energy high and be productive.
Doing alone resulted in lost of motivation during last day. It felt not important to polish the game before uploading.
Doing alone allow faster iteration cycles, and ability to change any aspect of game, without discarding others work in the team.
Jam gives opportunity to build and try mechanics that are unusual to board games.

Most valuable advices that I heard during jam:
* focus on the execution of the gameplay
* what player expected to feel while playing the game?
